# Hi! I'm Roberto Espeso ðŸ‘‹

I am a **Junior Frontend Developer** with a solid background in design, having graduated as a **Multimedia Designer** and I am currently working in that profession. My journey has given me an understanding of the importance of visual interfaces and user experience, which I now combine with my growing passion for coding.

### ðŸ’» **Technologies and Skills:**
- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML5** | **CSS3** (Variables, Animations, Responsive Design, Mobile First, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Sass)
  - **JavaScript** (ECMAScript 6-13: Variables, Functions, Closures, Scopes, Iterations, Loops, Arrays, DOM Manipulation, Objects, Classes, Asynchronous Programming, REST API Consumption, Debugging with Chrome DevTools, NPM)
- **Design and Tools:**
  - Figma
  - Flowcharts and Entity-Relationship Diagrams
- **Databases and Others:**
  - SQL
  - Logical thinking and problem-solving

### ðŸš€ **Notable Projects:**

1. **[Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://robertoespeso.github.io/rps.github.io/)** (2024)  
   A simple interactive game where players face off with classic rules. This project helped me practice DOM manipulation and implement conditional logic for building a fun and functional user interface.

2. **[Landing page to practice asynchronous programming and REST API consumption](https://robertoespeso.github.io/MaravillaMartinez/)** (2024)  
   A landing page developed to consume and display data from a REST API. In this project, I focused on understanding and applying asynchronous JavaScript, using `fetch` to dynamically retrieve data and effectively render it.

3. **[To Do List](https://robertoespeso.github.io/ToDoSuper.github.io/)** (2023)  
   A task management app designed to help users organize their activities. It uses local storage to save tasks, allowing me to deepen my understanding of data persistence in the browser, along with array and object manipulation in JavaScript.

4. **[Multimedia Design Agency Landing Page](https://robertoespeso.github.io/Turuweb.github.io/index.html)** (2022)  
   A landing page showcasing the services of a fictional design agency. The goal was to create a visually appealing and functional website that responds well to mobile devices. I practiced responsive design and interface optimization here.

5. **[Landing Page with Interactive Minigame](https://robertoespeso.github.io/Imaginaudio.github.io/index.html)** (2022)  
   This project features a landing page with an embedded minigame, allowing me to experiment with JavaScript events, game logic, and interactive design to enrich the user experience.

### ðŸ›  **Projects in Development:**
- **Social Network Base:** Practicing REST API consumption, file uploads, and data management to create a user profile and basic social functionalities (save, delete, request new content).
- **Ecommerce:** A project focused on data persistence, payment gateway integration, and user-friendly interface design.
- **Turn-based RPG Game:** Advanced exploration of array manipulation and DOM handling, along with optimizing constructor classes to improve my knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

### ðŸ”­ **Next Steps:**
I am currently specializing in **JavaScript** before moving on to **React** and **Node.js** to complete my development stack.

### ðŸŽ¯ **About Me:**
Programming allows me to find solutions to everyday problems and optimize processes, from automating repetitive tasks to creating more efficient interactive experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading **personal development, marketing, business, and psychology** books, as well as **working out**, **meditating**, **playing with pets**, and **traveling** to discover new places.
